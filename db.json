The show combines live action with CGI dinosaurs.</p><p>Dan learns about dinosaurs as he conducts experiments on \"dinosaurs\" that he sees in his environment. It is unknown if they are real or the result of his active imagination, but other characters accept that Dan sees them. Some animals, such as Dan's dog, have also seen them, and in the episode \"Dino Trackers\", Dan's younger brother can also see the dinosaur tracks.</p>",
